The bees are rapidly declining, especially in relation to how rapidly the human population is increasing. This affects us in ways that most people do not realize. Although the most important factor in their colony decrease is the pesticides, I thought it was realistic to look at in comparison to a population that benefits largely from the bees. The honey bees have been placed on the endangered species list so when people see my project, I want them to understand how human population is increasing in proportion to the bees. </p><p>
	I learned a lot about plot.ly with this project. I played around with bokeh, but once I started using plot.ly I found it easier to use and comprehend. Since I chose to embed my charts onto my profile so that they are interactive and not a static image, they take a very long time to load. This slows down my website and the whole feeling of it being modern and informative. Since I had already mastered tuples and plotting on synthesis-1, I decided to focus on the additional things that plot.ly has to offer. I figured out how to do the dropdown menu, add labels to the axes, and make the graphs transparent. I wanted to focus on making the site look professional and well thought out. I chose colors that are associated with bees to keep the site consistent with the idea I was putting across. </p><p>
Even though I was figuring out python by problem solving, I ran into a lot of conflicts when it came to design. I could not decide how I wanted to present the data. I had significantly much less data to work with this time which made it easier to graph, but I felt restricted on how I could show it. I had started with scatter plots, but they did a terrible job of representing the proportions I was trying to show. That is when I discovered the stacked bar graph. Although I wanted something more creative and interactive, the stacked bar did what I need it to do. I had big ideas of pictograms that showed up using Javascript and showed different things when you clicked on different population amounts, but I do not have the skills for that yet. I tried it a little bit, but was very unsuccessful and undetermined. </p> <p>
	Once I had the stacked bar, I was just feeding the data in the csv to python and printing out what you could probably seeing just from looking at it. The population was so high that you could not even tell what the colonies trend looked like. So I found the average number of bees per colony and divided the human population by it. This made the numbers smaller and easier to compare. </p> <p>
	I decided to add more to the site by add pictures of major foods we would lose. To me, this made it a more relevant website. It is easier to see the affect it would have on people. Most people assume that we would just lose honey, but the effects are much more drastic than that. It is important to inform people of this because most do not know how to help. And it is very simple to make a couple changes that could make a huge difference to the bee population.
