  				<h3>The End?</h3>
 				 <p>In Synthesis 2 I drew ideas off of my previous data set (the <a href="https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/">Million Song Dataset</a>) that I used to create a word cloud of popular words in song titles, which you can see <a href="https://alexamarzina.github.io/synthesis-1/data-representation/">here</a>. The goal for this project was to produce a line graph — in Python — to compare the number of titles that contained the word “love” by year. I did indeed produce a graph; it was the line part that proved to be quite difficult.
				</p>

				<p>Simply because of time restraints (as I’m sure everyone can relate), I was unable to troubleshoot the graph and produce a working line. I am however, very proud of being able to accomplish the following: read a CSV file into a Jupyter notebook, make a list out of data cells from individual columns, remove certain values (like the year 0) from a list, join lists together, and convert types of variables (Strings, floats, lists, etc.) into other data types. Maybe I do know more than I think I do but just take more time that others to show it. Maybe I am even OK with that.</p>
 				 
 				 <p>Another issue altogether is Github. I was so excited because I thought I finally understood how to fully utilize it — in terms of this project, anyway. I was doing great; I cloned a repository, added stuff to it, committed it, and… it wouldn’t let me push it to my master branch. Which I was confused about. It made it seem like I wanted to push it to YOUR master branch, which obviously I didn’t want; I had the repository forked and cloned, which led me to believe that I would push to MY repository, but my computer had other ideas, I guess. Github still remains a mystery to me, for now.</p>

				<p>I also switched my HTML and CSS up a bit. I did use the basic skeleton that I utilized in the Skills Development and Synthesis 1 assignments, but I tried to use divs instead of one-cell tables for the text (which didn’t really yield the results that I particularly wanted, but sometimes that’s OK!) as well as switched up the navigation bar thanks to <a href="https://designshack.net/articles/css/creating-a-fun-animated-navigation-menu-with-pure-css">this tutorial</a> — though I didn’t opt for the animation option because I didn’t really think it would “fit” in with the feel of the site. </p>
			
				<p>I pride myself on being brutally honest, delightfully sassy, and just charming enough to convince people to doing what I want them to do — most of the time. So, for the rest of this statement, I will be exactly all of those things. This project is a flop, garbage even, and I know that. But there’s a bigger issue here. College is awful! Life is unfair! What even is the point of trying to succeed in these things?!</p>
			
				<p>Which is how I’ve been feeling for literally all of my post-secondary education and it is only getting worse as time passes. Full disclosure, I was so anxious during the review session that I literally thought I was going to vomit all over the lab. I was maybe seconds away but I maintained my composure. This, as you can expect, made the rest of the day exceedingly difficult; now, imagine this feeling every day. That is my life as a student.</p>
				
				<p>This isn’t me complaining (OK, maybe a little bit), but that’s just sad and messed up. Lately, college has only been about test scores and GPA, which are things that shouldn’t define a person, instead of their personality or other things that are more accurate descriptions. This is getting rambly, so I’ll stop — even though <a href="https://www.freshu.io/alexa-marzina/the-importance-of-asl-and-deaf-culture-in-today-s-hearing-world">writing</a> seems to be one of the few skills I still possess.</p>

				<p>So, even though this project isn’t exactly what I wanted it to be, it’s done. I’m happy (that it’s over). I just genuinely hope that I have <b>something</b> to contribute to my team for the Team Assignment so I don’t let them down like I constantly let everyone else in my life, including myself, down.</p>
