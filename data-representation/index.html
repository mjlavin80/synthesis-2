  				<h3>You can't win 'em all...</h3>
 				 <p>Well. Again, this project was a time. However,
 				 this time I had less help (and by help I mean hand-holding)
 				 so it came out definitely less successful than the first 
 				 time! Love when that happens.</p>
 				 
 				 <p>Anyway, as you can see from the first image below,
 				 it is <b>totally</b> a line graph comparing the amount 
 				 of songs that have "love" in the title between the years 1920
 				 (so long ago that it was basically year 0) and 2010. Every
 				 year had at least one, I guess! Neat!!!</p>

        	<div style="color:black" width=500px>
 				 <p>The photo below displays the tried (and failed) code
 				 for producing the line graph. It's still a graph, though,
 				 so, like, that's cool I guess.</p>
 				 
 				 <p>I don't know what went wrong â€” I Googled the <b>crap</b>
 				 out of all of this and everything (literally) always
 				 yielded errors that I didn't even know what they meant.
 				 Then again, I don't really know what went wrong in my
 				 life, either, so at least this project parallels my
 				 daily struggles of attempting to be a human being
 				 and my subsequent failures.</p>

        	<div style="color:black" width=500px>
 				 <p>I'm sure you'll be immediately able to look at this
 				 code snippet and tell me at least five places where
 				 I went wrong, and that's the funniest part! No matter
 				 how many times I try to succeed in life, something
 				 shuts me down immediately! It's almost scary how
 				 quickly others can identify my mistakes before I do,
 				 so I'm glad that at least some people have their life
 				 together and actually possess notable skills.</p>
