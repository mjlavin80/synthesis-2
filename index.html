 				<p>Despite only differing in name by one character,
 				Synthesis 2 proved to be much different than Synthesis
 				1. Isn't that nuts? This data viz was not a successful
 				for me as its predecessor, which makes total sense to
 				me because I think that as I am aging the less I have
 				to offer the world. My mom tells me not to say that I'm
 				having a "mid-life" crisis because I'm far away from the
 				end of my life. I agree, but I think we are thinking in
 				different directions here. Not trying to be morbid, I'm
 				just saying.
 				
 				<p>Below is a great example of a data viz! Did I make it?
 				What a silly question; of course not! But I can, however,
 				appreciate its usefulness, style and accuracy. Take a look.</p>

 				<p>As you can see, the amount of college students seeking
 				university counseling for things like depression and anxiety
 				is on the rise. I really couldn't tell you why. <i>I never
 				feel stressed or overwhelmed by the demands of college:
 				classes, homework, studying, activities, trying to keep my
 				mental health at a healthy level...</i> Nope, it's all a 
 				piece of cake.</p>
 				
 				<p>Moving on, please enjoy my data visualization that you
 				should be able to access from the navigation bar above.
 				(But who knows, I probably messed that up, too!)</p>
