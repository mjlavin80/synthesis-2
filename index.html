        			<p>Synthesis 1 challenged me a lot. Even though there was "less" to do in terms of specifics compared to the Skills Development assignment, this project was still more involved. My biggest issue with this project was troubleshooting. I would use the internet as a big resource for finding out how to code things, but I would have to tweak them, which would lead to an error. At this point — with my limited coding knowledge — I never knew how to fix these errors despite trying whatever I thought would work.
        			</p>
        			<br>
        			<p>Also, fun fact: one of the times when I tried to update my CSS (so it wasn't all pink anymore) it just broke and none of the formatting would show up online. That was fun to deal with. <b>Not.</b>
        			</p>
        			<br>
        			<p>Anyway, this synthesis is a word cloud showing the popularity of words (minus stopwords) of songs from the 10,000 song subset of the <a href="https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/">Million Song Dataset</a>. <strikethrough>Surprisingly, I had more trouble than I should have with actually viewing the image of the data representation once I made it. The code to save it to the desktop (from Jupyter) saved a file to my computer, but it was just a blank image. So, I ended up having to just save the visualization it produced in the notebook itself and upload it to Tinypic to get a link to use in the HTML. Hey, maybe I am getting better at troubleshooting!</strikethrough>
        			</p>
        			<br>
        			<p>Just kidding, the only problem I had was not knowing how to use an image on the desktop in the code — Google results told me that if I used an image from the desktop only I would be able to see it — so I just uploaded it to online so I could display it here.
