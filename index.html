<header> My data visualization </header>
<p1> For this Artist Synthesis, I decided to take my data set to the next level by making an interactive data visualization. Although it was a challenge since I am novice coder, I was incredibly proud of the end product, especially because I did most of the Python myself. Also, when I first found the Texas bokeh file that I used as the skeleton for the data visualization, I wanted my data visualization to look like that, which it did! If you would have told me at the beginning of the semester that I would have accomplished this, I wouldn't have believed you since I came into this class with absolutely no coding skill. This data visualization shows the percentages of Texas executions per county. The darker the county, the higher the percentage of executions. </p1>
<header> How this connects with Synthesis 1 </header>
<p2> I used the same data set from last time, which was the Texas death row information since 1982. They actually updated the data set from the last time I checked the website - the last execution was March 14 - so I used the same CSV file from Synthesis 1 that ended in January 2017 for consistency. <a href=" http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html">Source</a> Synthesis 2 also used the same data scraping skills used in Synthesis 1 to get the data from CSV to snazzy interactive. I had to upload the CSV into Jupyter Notebooks, sort the data, and apply a cat code so the qualitative data had a number to it. Then, I took this cat code to make a datavisualization, just like in the last Artist Synthesis. </p2>
<header> How this is different from Synthesis 1 </header>
<p3> As you can see, the interactive is much more, well, interactive than it was in Synthesis 1. Here, I used Python to turn the qualitative data into numbers, and then I used Bokeh to turn that data into a shape. I found a data visualization of Texas unemployment rates online <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery/texas.html">Source</a> so I used that code as a shell for my own data visualization. Then, I sort of Frankenstein-ed my code into the shell so the values for Texas execution rates showed up instead of Texas unemployment rates. Although the hover tool is kind of lazy for an interactive, I'm fine with using it because I'm just impressed that I somehow managed to do this. </p3>
<header> Small mishaps and what to change for next time </header>
<p4> Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I could not figure out how to save my data viualization out so the interactive features could come out. It's a .PNG on this website, but I included a .ipynb file called Executions.counties in the synthesis-2 folder that shows my work and the data visualization with the interactive elements. Also, I could not figure out how to change the percentages to numbers since I wanted to show the exact number of executions per county. If I had more time, these would be the first two things I would fix. I would also use the most recent execution data because there have been two more executions since I used my data for Synthesis 1. Also, I think it would be really interesting to turn all of the offender's last statements into a word cloud - I noticed frequent use of the words y'all and God just by reading them, so I wonder if this is true. I'd like to plot out the ages, too, because I noticed one of the prisoners was 29 when he was executed - I'd like to see if there's a average age for executed prisoners. I'm really lucky I found this interesting data set that I can do so much with going forward. I'm hopping I can convince my team to use it for the team-based project. </p4>
