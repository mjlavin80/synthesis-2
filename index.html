    <h1>Data Visualization: Healthy Ride Bike Share System in Pittsburgh</h1>
    <p>In Pittsburgh, the push for more bicycle-friendly regulations and infrastructure, such as roadway bike paths and bike racks, have taken hold in the past few years and made biking a somewhat more feasible commuting method for city residents. Biking is a healthier and cheaper transportation method than cars, buses, or the city’s small light rail system, but it still has a long way to go as a mainstream option in Pittsburgh. In response to this issue, a local non-profit called Pittsburgh Bike Share created Healthy Ride, a public bike share system with rental locations in neighborhoods across the city — but as I discovered in my research, the system needs substantial improvements to make biking a mainstream commuting method in the city comparable to cars or buses.
</p>
    <p>For this project, I examined the neighborhoods with Healthy Ride bike racks and compared the number of these racks with the amount of public bus stops. Comparing how the bike racks in each neighborhood compared to the bus stops in that same neighborhood illustrates how biking through this system compares to the ease of other commuting methods, namely taking the local buses. I have compiled this data into the bar chart.</p>
    
    <p>In every neighborhood, the number of bus stops absolutely dwarfs the number of Healthy Ride bike racks. I even included an extra y-axis tick between 0 and 10 to make the number of bike racks clearer, as there are no more than 10 racks in any neighborhood — but the number of bus stops is as high as 132 (in Shadyside, specifically). 
</p>
    <p>The highest proportion of racks to bus stops in any neighborhood is only about 11% (as is the case in Downtown), and this proportion dips as low as 1.67% (as in the Hill District). With these kinds of numbers, it’s unsurprising that biking has yet to take hold as a primary transportation option in Pittsburgh; the present availability of public bicycles is far too low to create widespread change. </p>
    <p>To analyze the data further, I also calculated the proportion of Healthy Ride bike racks in each neighborhood compared to the total number across the city, figuring out where these racks are most heavily concentrated; the more racks in a neighborhood, the more viable an option using this system is. I compiled this data into the pie chart.</p>
    
    <p>Unsurprisingly, Oakland is a close second to Downtown in bike rack concentration. The area is home to immense numbers of students, many of whom live, work, and attend classes within the neighborhood’s boundaries, and parking is a long-recognized problem there. Combined with a large young population, these factors make Oakland an ideal area for transport by bike.</p>
    <p>However, not all of the data is so straightforward. The bike racks are most heavily concentrated Downtown, the heart of Pittsburgh and home to the central business district and many of the city’s biggest employers. The area is also largely work-centric, not residential, so it is unsurprising that Healthy Ride has focused on this commuter-heavy area. What is surprising, though, is Downtown’s surrounding neighborhoods don’t contain many bike racks. Uptown, the North Shore, and the Hill District border the Golden Triangle, but these neighborhoods contain the lowest proportion of bike racks in the entire system. Whether the residents are not receptive to commuting on bikes or the terrain is not bike-friendly (which seems unlikely for the North Shore, considering the number of bridges connecting it to Downtown), there may be factors at play that explain this absence. </p>
    <p>Biking may be a more common transportation method for Pittsburghers in the future, especially for commuting, but this is simply not the case today. The Healthy Ride system may be an accessible way for residents to get around, especially in neighborhoods with a high concentration of its bike racks, but as things stand now, buses are a far more accessible option, and there are explanations missing for the notable lack of bike racks in some neighborhoods. This may be an area for future research as many Pittsburgh residents continue to push for biking as a healthier and cheaper way to travel the city.
