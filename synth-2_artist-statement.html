                <p> I am quite a bit prouder of this second data visualization assignment. I created
                    my own dataset, if a small, incomplete one, and my understanding of how to use
                    the tutorials to work with matplotlib certainly improved. Most importantly, I
                    think my subject is more interesting, and also worthier of being pursued with
                    additional resources. </p>
                <p>My project looks at the rise of populism in Europe compared to the rise of
                    recorded instances of hate crimes. It uses the percentage results of recent
                    elections and hate crime data recorded by the Office for Democratic Institutions
                    and Human Rights. I would either say it complicates the commonplace, depending
                    on how solidified someone’s feelings about the “truth” of populism are, or is a
                    subject from history, if you consider the last couple years as (recent) history.
                    It charts the populist percentage of the vote of five countries, Austria,
                    France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as they are some of
                    the most prominent in recent news regarding elections and populism. It then
                    compares by turn the country’s hate crime data in a separate line graph. </p>
                <p>Several problems immediately arose when I was compiling my data set. Fist, time.
                    I would have loved to have far more countries represented, perhaps creating a
                    chloropleth that, in increasing shades of red, represented the populist vote all
                    over Europe. Although that would be cool, alarming, and probably misleading, I
                    couldn’t find a data set like that for all of Europe, and did not have enough
                    time to create one. Also, the infrequency and varied timing of elections made it
                    difficult to compare these results. As can be seen in my original dataset, there
                    are several years that go by without any election. I ended up having to repeat
                    the number from one year until the next election in order for the graph to make
                    sense. The hate crime data was another difficulty, as the numbers were very
                    inconsistent, likely because definitions and recording practices for hate crimes
                    in different countries are also inconsistent. I don’t know enough of statistics
                    to be able to make a comparison, nor do I really think a comparison in one graph
                    would be valid, so I separated them. </p>
                <p>I followed the tutorial on our GitHub that demonstrated how to create a
                    matplotlib line graph, with only a few modifications. Going through line-by-line
                    and reading the comments, then only writing the line myself once I understood
                    what it did, was a real help to my learning process. I had a bit of an issue
                    printing the images, as savefig(), which had worked on my last project, just
                    saved a blank page. I eventually just used a screenshot, so the quality is a bit
                    low. My one real regret was not having enough time to devote to using JavaScript
                    to make my site interactive. Right now the page uses links to travel between
                    hate crime data for each country, which is inconvenient for loading and causes a
                    lot more scrolling than I’d like. </p>
                <p>I believe, if my team is interested, we could take this concept even farther,
                    like the site which I got most of my data from,
                    http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/03/europe/populism-in-europe-visual-guide/, which
                    included immigration and GDP data. I think it’s definitely a topic that is
                    relevant and worthwhile, if we have the time to create an accurate dataset and
                    more valid, less misrepresenting graphs for it. </p>
